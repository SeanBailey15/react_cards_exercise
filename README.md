# React Cards Exercise

## Description

In this exercise, students gain experience refactoring logic in React components by writing custom React hooks to consolidate repetitive functionality.  

Given a completed and functional application that displays two types of playing cards, students are instructed to consolidate the logic that controls flipping a card face up/down into a custom hook, and do the same with the logic for making the external API calls that retrieve the card data.

## Installation

My solution for this exercise will be found in the code itself, though the solution can be verified as functional if you would like to clone this repository and try it out for yourself. Follow these steps to get started:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/SeanBailey15/react_cards_exercise.git
    ```

2. Navigate into the directory:

    ```bash
    cd react_cards_exercise
    ```

3. Install the dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. Run the app:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
